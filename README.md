### Features

- **Mirror System** — ISRC-first resolution with automatic query fallback for mirrored sources.
- **In-Memory LRU Search Cache** — Ultra-fast memory cache resolving repeated search requests in `< 1ms` without querying remote APIs.
- **Automated Disk Quota Management** — Enforces hard disk caps (e.g. 10GB) with oldest-track LRU auto-eviction to prevent host storage saturation.
- **Resilient Spotify Multi-Market Failover Ring** — Automatically cascades across secondary markets (`US` -> `GB` -> `DE` -> `IN`) when tracks are geo-restricted.
- **YouTube Client Rotation** — Rotates between WEB, ANDROID, IOS, TVHTML5, and WEB_EMBEDDED clients with cooldown tracking.
- **PoToken Session Warmer & Pool** — Autonomous visitor session pool with background renewal every 30 minutes.
- **Adaptive Range Streaming** — Throttling mitigation using HTTP Range requests and multi-format audio fallback candidate stepping.
- **ATV Counterpart Track Swapping** — Detects music videos and swaps in clean YouTube Music audio tracks (`MUSIC_VIDEO_TYPE_ATV`) to bypass video skits and intro chatter.
- **Dual-Format Disk Cache & Sidecars** — Verifies cached WebM/M4A audio headers and maintains structured `<videoId>.json` metadata sidecars.
- **Search Autocomplete Endpoint** — Provides real-time search query suggestions via `/v4/solaceaudio/youtube/suggest`.
- **Bot & PoToken Protection** — Soft-fails blocked clients on 429s, 403s, and login/bot challenges, rotating to next available client.
- **Region & Availability Bypass** — Retries unavailable or geo-blocked tracks with alternate region parameters before failing.
- **Spotify Canvas Extraction** — Resolves animated canvas MP4 video URLs for tracks via `spclient.wg.spotify.com/canvaz-cache`.
- **Multi-Seed Recommendations** — Supports `sprec:` queries with multiple track and artist seeds (`seed_tracks=`, `seed_artists=`).
- **Gaana Native Streaming** — Fully persistent HLS chunk buffering directly from Akamai CDN.
- **Native Lyrics** — Built-in integration with LavaLyrics for Spotify color lyrics.
- **Smart Recommendations** — Source-aware recommendation engine using Spotify Radio, YouTube RD Mix, and Last.fm audioscrobbler.
- **Spring Boot 3.2+ Compatible** — Explicit parameter name mappings for Lavalink REST controllers.
- **Zero HTTP Dependencies** — Relies entirely on Java's native `HttpClient` for maximal performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What is Mirroring?
>
> Mirroring is the process of taking the metadata resolved from one source and using it to retrieve a playable `AudioTrack` from another provider.
